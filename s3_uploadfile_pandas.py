Actually, when you're using just `pandas` to read from or write to S3 directly, 
the explicit import of `s3fs` isn't strictly necessary in your script. 
It's `pandas` that internally depends on `s3fs` to handle S3 URLs, so you only need to ensure that `s3fs` is installed in the environment.

That being said, if you were to use some of the direct file system-like operations provided by the `s3fs` library itself 
(e.g., opening a file on S3, checking existence of a path on S3, etc.), then you would need to explicitly import `s3fs` and use its API.

For the specific examples I provided above, you're right: the line `import s3fs` is not needed, 
as we're leveraging only `pandas` functionality, which internally uses `s3fs` when encountering an S3 URL.
